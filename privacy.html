    <h1>Privacy Policy for Hercule (by Zafer Siar Konyar)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 15 October 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Hercule</strong>, published by <strong>Zafer Siar Konyar</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Android mobile application <strong>Hercule</strong> (the “App”).</p>

    <h2>1) Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data</strong>. You are not required to create an account or provide personal information to use the App. The App does <strong>not</strong> access contacts, location, photos/media, files, microphone, camera, or device identifiers, and we do <strong>not</strong> use analytics or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>2) Advertisements</h2>
    <p>The App may display <strong>third-party advertisements</strong> (e.g., Google AdMob). Ad networks may process <em>non-personally identifiable information</em> such as general device and interaction data to display and measure ads. The App itself does <strong>not</strong> collect or share personally identifiable information (PII). For details, refer to your ad provider’s policy (e.g., Google Ads/AdMob policies).</p>

    <h2>3) Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of those third parties. Please review their privacy policies before submitting any information.</p>

    <h2>4) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong>, and we do <strong>not knowingly collect</strong> personal information from children. If you believe a child provided personal information via the App, contact us so we can delete it.</p>

    <h2>5) Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect or store user data, we <strong>do not retain any user data</strong>. If future optional features require data (e.g., account sync), we will update this policy, request consent where required, and provide clear deletion controls.</p>

    <h2>6) Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the App. Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is <strong>no user-identifiable information</strong> at rest in our systems.</p>

    <h2>7) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will appear in-app and at this URL with an updated “Last updated” date.</p>

    <h2>8) Contact Us</h2>
